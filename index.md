The Data Curation for Reproducibility Curriculum aims to provide learners working in research data support roles with the practical knowledge and skills to properly execute data curation workflows that uphold the highest standard of data quality.

The goal of this introductory lesson is to give learners: 1. the foundational knowledge needed to understand and engage with research reproducibility; and 2. an overview of the strategies used by information professionals to manage, curate, and steward research data assets that serve as the evidence base for reported scientific findings. This lesson also prepares learners to perform data curation for reproducibility activities taught in follow-up lessons. 

To establish a shared understanding of what curating for reproducibility means and why the practice is critical to the scientific enterprise, this lesson covers quite a bit of ground. By committing the time necessary to learn these essential concepts and issues, learners will be better prepared to engage in activities for promoting and implementing data curation for reproducibility services.
