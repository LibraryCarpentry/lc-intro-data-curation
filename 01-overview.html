<p>Anyone working in an organization that supports or engages in
scientific research has likely encountered discussions about
reproducibility. In the past decade, various research stakeholders have
become more and more insistent in their calls for data sharing and
research transparency as a means of upholding the credibility of the
scientific outputs. This episode engages in these discussions and
illustrates the various reasons behind demands for reproducibility,
beginning with an exploration of the term, “reproducibility.”</p>
<section><h2 class="section-heading" id="defining-reproducibility">Defining “Reproducibility”<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#defining-reproducibility"></a></h2>
<hr class="half-width"><p>Reproducibility, which has emerged as a standard-bearer for
scientific integrity, considers what happens when a research study is
repeated. For example, a researcher discovers an article that reports
study findings, and then decides to conduct the same study to test
whether or not the results will be consistent in a subsequent iteration
of the study. If the results from the repeated study corroborate those
of the original study, then the results in the published article can be
considered reproducible.</p>
<p>However, the term “reproducibility” carries important assumptions
about the nature of the repeated study. In some contexts, the assumption
is that the repeated study applied the same methods and analyzed the
same data used by the original study investigator. In other contexts,
reproducibility implies that either the original methods or the original
data, but not both, were used to assess the integrity of results.</p>
<p>To disambiguate these various meanings, we specify three types of
reproducibility that articulate the primary distinctions among the
various conceptions of reproducibility defined by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-statistics-010814-020127" class="external-link">Victoria
Stodden (2015)</a>: <em>empirical reproducibility</em>, <em>statistical
reproducibility</em>, and <em>computational reproducibility</em>.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="empirical-reproducibility">Empirical Reproducibility<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#empirical-reproducibility"></a></h3>
<p><strong>original methods + new data</strong></p>
<p>Empirical reproducibility assumes that there is comprehensive
documentation of research methods and protocols to follow, and this
allows for subsequent studies to follow those same research methods and
protocols to collect and analyze data to yield results that corroborate
those reported by the original investigators.</p>
<p>In animal studies, repeating experiments to demonstrate empirical
reproducibility is expected. This requires standardization of
experimental conditions to ensure that inconsistencies in study
protocols are not the cause of inconsistencies in results. For mice
experiments, this includes the use of lab-specified cage types and
temperature, cage cleaning schedules, feeding protocols, etc. Despite
careful adherence to standards, it is known that one often overlooked
detail can affect the empirical reproducibility of experimental
results–the experimenter. For reasons yet to be fully understood,
differences among experimenters such as gender and attitude may
introduce enough variance in experimental conditions that are the cause
of empirical irreproducibility.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="statistical-reproducibility">Statistical Reproducibility<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#statistical-reproducibility"></a></h3>
<p><strong>new methods + original data</strong></p>
<p>Statistical reproducibility relies on the application of appropriate
statistical methods to yield defensible results. Studies that suffer
from statistical irreproducibility have weaknesses in the statistical
methods and analysis, which precludes the possibility of repeating the
study and yielding the same results.</p>
<p>Because of the impossibility of studying perpetually-changing
conditions of the Earth’s climate system, climate scientists test the
reliability of their global temperature projections using a coordinated
model intercomparison strategy. With this strategy, researchers run
different computational models using the same data inputs and then
compare the results produced by each model. Agreement among models
demonstrates statistical reproducibility, which suggests the reliability
of results. Disagreement, on the other hand, may indicate misapplication
of model algorithms or problematic model design indicative of
statistical irreproducibility.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="computational-reproducibility">Computational Reproducibility<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#computational-reproducibility"></a></h3>
<p><strong>original methods + original data</strong></p>
<p>Computational reproducibility considers scientific practice that
relies on computational methods to produce results. Simply put, it is
the ability to use the original data and code to produce identical
results as those of the original study.</p>
<p>The discovery of a single flaw in programming scripts used to analyze
chemistry data called into question over 100 published studies. The
issue was a module included in the script that required use of a
specific operating system to execute calculations to produce the correct
results. Researchers realized this only when they noticed inconsistent
results when running the scripts in different computing environments.
The inconsistencies, which demonstrate computational irreproducibility,
were significant enough to prompt researchers to reconsider the results
of their published studies. <br><br><strong>Suggested

<p>In discussions of reproducibility, you also may have seen the term
replicability used to describe any one of the three definitions provided
above. The terms reproducibility and replicability have been used
interchangeably and with conflating definitions, ultimately obfuscating
their intended meanings. However, it does seem that the scientific
community is converging on clearer definitions that capture the nuances
of these related terms.</p>
<p>A recent report published by the National Academies of Sciences,
Engineering and Medicine (2019) makes a clear distinction between
reproducibility and replicability as a means to resolve ambiguities in
the use of these and related terms. Their definitions are below as
presented in the report:<br><br></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Reproducibility</em> is obtaining consistent results using the
same input data; computational steps, methods, and code; and conditions
of analysis. This definition is synonymous with “computational
reproducibility[.]”</p>
<p><em>Replicability</em> is obtaining consistent results across studies
aimed at answering the same scientific question, each of which has
obtained its own data (p. 46).</p>

<p>The following challenge offers an opportunity to apply the
definitions of the three types of reproducibility to real-world
scenarios. Exploring these scenarios will help to solidify our
understanding of the nuances among the reproducibility types and their
definitions, and to see how irreproducibility can play out.</p>

<p>Read the descriptions of real-life instances in which published
research findings were discovered to be non-reproducible. Based on the
definitions of reproducibility types, determine
which—<strong>empirical</strong>, <strong>statistical</strong>, or
<strong>computational</strong>—applies to the scenario in each
description.</p>
<p><strong>Scenario 1: Slicing and Dicing Food Data</strong><br>
If you believe that shopping hungry compels you to make poor food
purchasing decisions or that the size of your plate can influence how
much you eat, you have a single university-based food lab to thank. Over
the past three decades, the principal investigator (PI) of this renowned
lab had over 250 articles published describing results of studies of
food-related behavior, many of which have entered the popular
imagination through mainstream media outlets. Some of these studies
informed the USDA’s Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion, which
issues dietary guidance for the National School Lunch Program,
Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), and other federally
sponsored nutrition programs.</p>
<p>A closer look at the lab’s research by other scientists and
statisticians, however, revealed considerable problems that would
prevent them from repeating the analyses of published works. What they
discovered was rampant p-hacking, a dubious practice in which
statistical tests are run repeatedly on a dataset in an attempt to yield
statistically significant results, irrespective of the research question
or hypothesis—if any—at hand. Beyond p-hacking, scientists also found
calculation errors including unfeasible means and standard deviations.
This was, perhaps, no accident, as evidenced by an email from the PI to
a lab member that instructed her to dig through a dataset to find
significant relationships among variables, writing, “I don’t think I’ve
ever done an interesting study where the data ‘came out’ the first time
I looked at it.” A few years later after these discoveries were made,
several of the PI’s publications were retracted and an academic
misconduct investigation prompted his removal from teaching and research
duties at the university.</p>
<p><strong>Scenario 2: Excel Fail</strong><br>
In 2013, a graduate student at the University of Massachusetts Amherst
was assigned a class project to select an article from an economics
journal and attempt to reproduce its findings. After several attempts,
the student was unsuccessful, assuming that he had made some mistake in
his own analysis. Even after obtaining the underlying analysis data from
the well-respected authors themselves, he was still unable to reproduce
the results. Upon closer inspection of the spreadsheet of data he was
given, however, he found a critical discovery that would shock the
entire field of economics.</p>
<p>That discovery was a basic Excel miscalculation, one that tested the
veracity of the findings from the influential article that was cited
over 4,000 times and used by governments to justify specific austerity
measures to address economic crises. While corrections to the analysis
yielded different results (which the student later published) from those
in the original article, the authors insisted that these differences did
not change their central findings. They did, however, acknowledge their
error in a public statement: “It is sobering that such an error slipped
into one of our papers despite our best efforts to be consistently
careful. We will redouble our efforts to avoid such errors in the
future.”</p>
<p><strong>Scenario 3: Power(less) Pose</strong><br>
With over 60,000 online views, one of the most popular TED Talks
convinced many people that “power posing” induces an actual sense of
increased power. The presenter, a social psychologist, shared the
results of a study she published along with two of her colleagues that
investigated the physiological and behavioral effects of posing in open,
expansive postures: wide stance, hands on hips. The authors found that
embodiments of power (i.e., power poses) cause a decrease of cortisol
(the stress hormone) while increasing testosterone and risk tolerance.
Based on these observations, they concluded that power posing manifests
actual feelings of power.</p>
<p>After other scientists repeated the study and failed to yield
comparable results that could demonstrate the robustness of the original
power pose findings, some in the scientific community cast doubt on the
soundness of the original study design and protocols. One of the most
vocal skeptics was one of the co-authors of the original study, who
later announced that “I do not believe that ‘power pose’ effects are
real.” Aside from the small sample size and a questionable participant
selection process, he explained that the experiment involved male and
female participants (not distinguished by gender) who performed
risk-taking tasks and subsequently were informed that they had won small
cash prizes. Because the act of winning increases testosterone levels,
there was no way to determine whether the increase in testosterone was
an effect of the power pose as the paper concluded, or if it was merely
an effect of winning. Despite this controversy, studies on power posing
continue–with varying results.</p>

<p><strong>Scenario 1 (Slicing and Dicing Food Data): Statistical
Reproducibility</strong><br>
In this scenario, research results were generated using an
inappropriate, dubious statistical technique. Statistical analyses were
also rife with errors and miscalculations, which would make it
impossible for anyone to arrive at the same results. This example
demonstrates lack of <em>statistical reproducibility</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Scenario 2 (Excel Fail): Computational
Reproducibility</strong><br>
In this scenario, the student attempted to reproduce the findings in a
journal article by using the authors’ own data used to generate the
results reported in the article. Unfortunately, Herndon was unable to do
so, which demonstrates a failure to <em>computationally reproduce</em>
the published results.</p>
<p><strong>Scenario 3 (Power(less) Pose): Empirical
Reproducibility</strong><br>
In this scenario, researchers repeated the steps of the original power
pose experiment but arrived at different results. Problems with the
study design and protocols rendered the original power pose study

<h3 class="callout-title">Spotlight: What About Qualitative Research?</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>Qualitative research methodologies do not rely on analyses of
quantitatively measurable variables (other than research that transforms
qualitatively derived data into quantitatively analyzable data, e.g.,
text mining, natural language processing), which is why some scholars
have argued that reproducibility standards do not or cannot apply to
qualitative research. There is no doubt, however, that findings from
qualitative studies must be subject to the same level of scrutiny as
those produced by their quantitative counterparts. Certainly, the
credibility of qualitative research is just as important as the
credibility of quantitative research. Assessing the reproducibility of
qualitative research is conceivable, albeit with a focus on
<strong>transparency</strong>.</p>
<p>Considering the more constructivist nature of most qualitative
research (in contrast to positivist quantitative research), assessments
of research integrity emphasize <em>production transparency</em> and
<em>analytic transparency</em>. Production transparency requires that
the processes for research participant selection, data collection, and
analytic interpretation—and the decisions that informed these
processes—be documented in explicit detail. Analytic transparency
demands clear descriptions and explanations of the methods and logic
used to draw conclusions from the data. For qualitative research, a high
degree of production and analytic transparency is prerequisite for
demonstrating research rigor and credibility.</p>

<hr class="half-width"><p>To appreciate the importance of scientific reproducibility, consider
the belief that autism is linked to vaccines. This notion first appeared
in a 1998 article by Andrew Wakefield and his colleagues, who reported
results of a study of a small group of children who had received the MMR
vaccine and were later diagnosed with autism. A subsequent examination
of the study protocols and data from health records, however, revealed
that no interpretation of the data could have reasonably concluded that
instances of autism diagnoses were linked to the vaccine. The Wakefield
articles eventually were retracted by the <em>Lancet</em> journal that
published them, and Wakefield was found guilty of scientific misconduct
and fraud. Our understanding of the relationship between autism and
vaccines is more reliably supported by the many studies and
meta-analyses of studies on the subject that have consistently shown
that vaccines do not cause autism.</p>
<p>For scientific claims to be credible, they must be able to stand up
to scrutiny, which is a hallmark of science. The scientific community
promotes the credibility of its claims through systems of peer review
and research replication. Confirmation of the reproducibility of
research results adds another necessary element of research checks and
balances, particularly with scientific research increasingly becoming
computationally intensive. <strong>The ability of a researcher to obtain
and use the data and analysis code from the author of published
scientific findings to reproduce those findings independently is an
essential standard by which the scientific community can judge the
integrity of the scientific record.</strong></p>
<p>Despite the vaccine-autism link having been disproven, Wakefield’s
research continues to be cited in anti-vaccine campaigns that spread
misinformation and disinformation about so-called dangers of vaccines.
Such campaigns have contributed to vaccine hesitancy, which has hindered
public health initiatives to reduce the spread of pandemic diseases
through vaccination. This example underscores the importance of recent
calls for reproducibility as a precondition of scientific publication.

<hr class="half-width"><p>There are plenty of high-profile examples of research that were found
to be irreproducible, prompting the question of whether or not science
is experiencing a “reproducibility crisis.” Recent studies to determine
the extent to which published research is or is not reproducible have
been concerning to many given that investigators were unable to
successfully reproduce findings from a significant portion of the
published research examined by investigators.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/533452a" class="external-link">2016 survey conducted
by the journal <em>Nature</em></a>, researchers were asked if there was
a reproducibility crisis in science. Of the 1,576 who responded to the
survey, 90% agreed that there was at least a slight crisis. 70% conceded
that they were unable to reproduce a study conducted by another
scientist, with over half admitting to being unable to reproduce a study
that they, themselves, conducted!</p>
<p><strong>The reasons for irreproducibility are plenty, but the issues
that appear quite often are the result of scientific practices that
overlook the data management and curation activities</strong>: missteps
in analysis workflows due to gaps in documentation, ethical and/or legal
violations of non-anonymized human subjects data or redistribution of
restricted proprietary data, code execution failures because of
computing environment mismatches, inconsistent analysis outputs from use
of the wrong data file versions, and lack of access of data and code to
reproduce results. Despite these seemingly minor issues, the
repercussions can be serious.</p>

<h3 class="callout-title">Spotlight: Yet Another Term: “Preproducibility”</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>In a 2018 article published in the journal <em>Nature</em>, Phillip
Stark offered another term for consideration for use in discussions of
reproducibility: <strong>preproducibility</strong>. He wrote, “An
experiment or analysis is preproducible if it has been described in
adequate detail for others to undertake it. Preproducibility is a
prerequisite for reproducibility…” (p. 613). The question of
reproducibility, according to Stark, is irrelevant if documentation of
research methods and protocols are insufficient or unavailable. Stark
declared his unequivocal stance on the subject, declining to review any
manuscript that is not preproducible.</p>

<p>Perhaps with the so-called reproducibility crisis in mind, various
research stakeholders have taken steps to promote and protect the
integrity of scientific research by issuing policies and/or guidelines
that require researchers to perform data management tasks to ensure data
are accessible and usable. This includes the funding agencies that
support research initiatives, scholarly journals that publish the
scientific record, and academic societies that establish standards for
research conduct.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="funding-agencies">Funding Agencies<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#funding-agencies"></a></h3>
<p>Funding agencies make billions of dollars in scientific investments
by sponsoring grant programs that provide support to research projects.
To maximize their investments, many funders have issued policies that
require grant awardees to make the materials produced in the course of
funded research activities publicly available. By doing so, the
scientific community can reuse datasets, analysis code, and other
research artifacts to extend and verify results. Below are examples of
funding agencies that have data policies in place.</p>

<p>As stewards of the scientific record, journals bear responsibility
for ensuring that the articles they publish contain verifiable claims.
Moreover, journals recognize the role they play in traditional tenure
and promotion structures, which appraise scientific productivity based
on publication of articles in scholarly journals. Thus, journal policies
that make publication contingent on data sharing and verification are
considered a promising tool for advancing research reproducibility.
Below are examples of journals with rigorous data policies.</p>

<p>Academic societies have taken up the issue of reproducibility in
updated professional codes of conduct or ethics. Citing responsibility
to advance research in their discipline, these formal documents obligate
researchers to enable others to evaluate their knowledge claims through
transparent research practices and public access to data and materials
underlying those knowledge claims. Below is a list of academic societies
that have issued policies or statements promoting data access and
research transparency.</p>

<ul><li>The term ‘reproducibility’ has been used in different ways in
different disciplinary contexts.</li>
<li>Computational reproducibility, which is the focus of this and
follow-up lessons, refers to the duplication of reported findings by
re-executing the analysis with the data and code used by the original
author to generate their findings.</li>
<li>Scientific reproducibility is not a novel concept, but one that has
been reiterated by prominent scholars throughout history as a
cornerstone of scientific practice.</li>
<li>Failed attempts to reproduce published scientific research are
considered by some to be reflective of an ongoing crisis in scientific
integrity.</li>
<li>Stakeholders have taken note of the importance of reproducibility
and thus have issued policies requiring researchers to share their
research artifacts with the scientific community.</li>
